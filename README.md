zenircbot-meme
==============
A zenircbot service that implements a !meme command to generate a meme img

Usage
=====
Top text is filled with message before the first '.' is encountered. Unless there is no '.', then all of the text is put on the bottom of the image.

Default image is the Aliens guy:

<img src="http://memecaptain.com/aliens.jpg" height="100" width="100" />

You can override the default image by putting an image url after the message surrounded by [].

Example
=======
<code>!meme I don't always test my code. But when I do, I do it in production [http://memecaptain.com/most_interesting.jpg]</code>

Note
====
The service will also send topic messages to the !meme command on topic change, if your version of zenircbot supports it.
I have a fork of it on my github, which supports it, and will update here after I send a pull request to wraithan.
